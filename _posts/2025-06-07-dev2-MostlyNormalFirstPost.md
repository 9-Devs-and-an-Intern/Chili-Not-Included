Hello, and welcome to Devlog #-1 of Chili Not Included (Working Title). <br> <br>
This entry is a test. <br>
If you fail, move on. <br>
If you succeed, please tell me how because I have grown accustomed to my surroundings and would like to remain here. <br> <br>
That's all for now. <br>
We'll post Devlog #0 when we figure out what happened to the beans. <br>
...and who opened the portal. <br>
...and where the intern disappeared to. <br>

        [Dev #4]: Beans recovered. Incident logged as #B-17 (‘Legume Misplacement, Tier 2’). Portal remains under review.

Until next time,  <br> <br>
Dev #2
