Hello, and welcome to Devlog #-1 of Chili Not Included (Working Title).

This entry is a test.
If you fail, move on.
If you succeed, please tell me how because I have grown accustomed to my surroundings and would like to remain here.

That's all for now. 
We'll post Devlog #0 when we figure out what happened to the beans.
...and who opened the portal.
..and where the intern disappeared to.
        [Dev #4]: Beans recovered. Incident logged as #B-17 (‘Legume Misplacement, Tier 2’). Portal remains under review.
Until next time, 
Dev #2
